# Welcome to Just-DNA-Seq

**Just-DNA-Seq** is an open-source personal genomics platform designed to unlock the secrets of your DNA. We empower you with transparent insights into your genetic predispositions—covering longevity, health risks, and drug responses—so you can make informed decisions about your well-being.

## What We Offer

- **Personalized Genomic Reports:**  
  Upload your VCF files to generate detailed analyses on longevity-associated variants, disease risks, polygenic risk scores (PRS), and pharmacogenetics.

- **Modular & Transparent:**  
  Built on the robust OakVar framework, our system lets you mix and match analysis modules to suit your interests—all while keeping the algorithms and data sources open and transparent.

- **Privacy & Flexibility:**  
  Run analyses locally or on our server, ensuring that your genomic data remains private and secure.
